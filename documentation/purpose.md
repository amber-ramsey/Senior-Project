# Statement of Purpose

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a customizable testing application for teachers and researchers is often time consuming due to the fact they end up having to make their own since there is not an application that has everything they are wanting to accomplish. Creating a new application for each new research project or test is time consuming and a waste of space, especially when an application can only serve one purpose. For example, there have been numerous aptitude tests created from various sources, and these websites are only created for that purpose. When users visit these websites, they typically only use it the one time. If there was a site that was more customizable for the users and the test creators, it would have a more consistent usage by both test creators and users. This more customizable application could be used for a variety of quizzes, tests, and surveys which allows professors and researchers to simply add their questions to a new evaluation and publish it. This eliminates the time of creating a new application each time and saves space by having all of the tests be located in one place.
